# redis-jiggery-pokery

Some additions I have for the Redis client in C# based off StackExchange.Redis and RedLock.

I aim to make this a simple abstraction layer from the stuff that needs to be done by hand for Redis using the aforementioned packages. This is still quite a work in progress so pardon the lack of features.

**NOT READY FOR USE YET**
